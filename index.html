            <img src="Screenshot (56).png" alt="Placement Management System" class="project-photo">
            <p>The Placement Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline the placement process. It features a secure login system for both placement officers and students, ensuring proper authentication. Placement officers can manage company applications, while students can log in to apply for placements. Students must first update their profiles with academic information such as CGPA, skills, and relevant results. Once a student applies for a placement, they receive a confirmation email from the company. Upon receiving this confirmation, students need to update their selection status, making it visible to the placement officers. I developed this project in the first semester of my second year.</p>
